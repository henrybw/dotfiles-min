A lightweight fork of my [dotfiles](https://bitbucket.org/hbw/dotfiles) repo.

This is a "minimal" subset of my general-purpose dotfiles, intended for use in
more resource-constrained environments, e.g. a shell account on a remote server
that I access via ssh. For those setups, pulling down a nearly 20MB repository
full of stuff like X11 configs seems rather unnecessary...
